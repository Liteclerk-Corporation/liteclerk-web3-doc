# How to listing tokens
1. Fetch Token Data:
    Use Polkadot's APIs or blockchain explorers to retrieve token details.
2. Token Categories:    
    All Tokens: Include all tokens on the Polkadot network, such as DOT and parachain tokens.
3. Data Sources:
    Use Polkadot.js API or Substrate-based tools to fetch token balances and metadata.

# Sorting and Filtering Tokens
1. How to Sort Tokenn (Sorting can be implemented based on specific fields:)

    * By Balance: Sort tokens by the total balance (e.g., descending order to show the largest holdings first).
    * By Name: Alphabetically sort tokens by their names or symbols.
    * By Value: Sort based on the current market price of the token (requires integration with price feeds from exchanges like Coinbase or Binance).

2. How to Filter Tokens (Filtering allows narrowing down the list based on criteria:)

    * By Type:
        -Governance tokens (e.g., DOT).
        -Parachain-specific tokens.

    * By Activity:
        -Staked vs. unstaked tokens.
        -Locked vs. liquid tokens.

    * By Account:

        which adjusts prices dynamically based on supply and demand

    * Transparency & Trustworthiness:
        Displaying fields like "Creator Address," "Mint Address," and "Primary Sale Status" aligns with Pump.fun
        Emphasis on fair launches and transparency by providing verifiable data about each token's origin
